# Memory

Develop the card game "Memory" with all knowledge you have gained in React, JavaScript, HTML and CSS over the last few weeks.

To start all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The goal of the game is to find all pairs of matching cards.

The images to use are provided in "/public/img" folder of the scaffolded Create-React-App.

Provide a "Reset" button which enables the player restart the game at any time.
